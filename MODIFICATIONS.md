# Modifications

Gust is Goose (https://github.com/aardappel/goose, Apache-2.0) with the
changes below. Every file that differs from Goose's carries a notice at its
top pointing here. The exact changes are the commits Gust adds to Goose's
history:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/aardappel/goose
git fetch upstream
git log upstream/master..main
```

## Toolchain

- `src/toolchain.h`: on Windows, also look for clang in
  `%ProgramFiles%\LLVM\bin`, where the LLVM installer puts it without adding
  it to PATH, before falling back to MSVC through vcvars64; the not-found
  message names that place. The default `GOOSE_HOME` is `~/.gust`.
- `docs/design/packages.md`: the not-found message as it now reads.

## Name

- `CMakeLists.txt`: the compiler builds as `gust` (`OUTPUT_NAME`); the CMake
  target keeps Goose's name.
- `src/main.cpp`: the help and the driver's messages call the command
  `gust` and source files `file.gust`; `gust version` prints
  `gust runtime <version>`. Imports resolve through `SourceFile`.
- `src/utils.h`: `SourceFile` and `IsSourceExtension`: a source path
  resolves to `.gust` where that file exists, else `.goose`.
- `src/builtin.h`, `src/packages.h`, `src/native.h`: package entries and
  native-part sources are found with either extension.
- `README.md` is Gust's; Goose's is kept as `GOOSE.md`. `ROADMAP.md` and this
  file are new.

## Safety options

- `src/main.cpp`: `--checked` defines `GS_DEBUG=1`, the overflow, `as`
  range and tag checks of `--debug`, without `--debug`'s unoptimized
  debugger build: an optimized program that aborts on signed overflow
  instead of wrapping.
- `src/main.cpp`: `--externs` lists every `extern fn` outside the standard
  library and the packages compiled into the compiler (the C a program
  calls, which the safety rules cannot see into); `--deny-externs` makes
  each one an error.

## Scripts and tests

- `scripts/toolchain.py`, `scripts/check_doc_examples.py`: find a `gust`
  binary under `build/`, and a `goose` one from before the rename.
- `scripts/package_release.py`, `test/lsp_sweep.py`,
  `test/toolchain_selection.py`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`,
  `.github/workflows/release.yml`: the binary is `gust`, and releases are
  named `gust-<version>-<platform>` and titled `Gust <version>`.
- `.github/workflows/*.yml`: the GitHub actions are on their Node.js 24
  versions (checkout, setup-python and setup-node v7, upload-artifact v7,
  download-artifact v7, configure-pages v6, upload-pages-artifact and
  deploy-pages v5), as GitHub retires Node.js 20 on its runners.
- `test/run_tests.py`: the driver checks expect the `gust` wording and test
  `.gust` sources (a program importing a `.gust` and a `.goose` module); the
  no-C-compiler check also hides `%ProgramFiles%` and `%ProgramW6432%`; new
  checks cover `--checked` (an overflow aborts, optimized) and `--externs` /
  `--deny-externs`.
